• Why are all the reported times zero?

  Because this function is runs very fast to the point where the time 's extremely close to 0.

• Why is factors_itr only called once every time the program is run?

  factors_itr is called once for each row of the all array in the allFactors_itr function. For each new row that is added to all, factors_itr is called to compute and find theprime factors. Therefore, factors_itr is called multiple times, but only once per new product that is added to all.
      
• Is there an obvious mathematical relationship between the input number and the number of recursive calls? What about the number of prime factors each number produces?

  The bigger the input number is, the more recursive calls are made. Also, the bigger the input number is, the more prime factors it has.
